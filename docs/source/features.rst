Here are some features tapioca supports. The wrapper you are using may support them or not, it will depend on the `tapioca-wrapper` version it is tied to and if the developer implemented the methods needed to support the feature. Either way, if you find yourself in a situation where you need one of these features, clone the wrapper, update the `tapioca-wrapper` version to the latest one, implement the features you need and submit a pull request to the developer. You will be helping a lot of people!
